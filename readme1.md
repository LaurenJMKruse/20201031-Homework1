Refactoring Exising Code: Applying Semantics and Accessibility Features

User Story: Marketing agency requests codebase that follows accessibility standards so site is optimized for search engines

Changes applied:
Title - Given descriptive value
Comments - Added throughout for documentation and informative purposes
"Search Engine Optimization" link repaired
Links - Tooltips added to advise user on their purpose and optimize search engine results
Large Image - Changed from background image to "regular" image; this is so it will not be lost with high contrast settings
Semantics applied throughout
Aside - To comply with high contrast preferences, I attempted to change the color of the three icons to white. The filter function failed, and so the next best option was to change the font to black to match the icons, and lighten the background color. Spacing was also tweaked to better enable the user to see what text went with what icons
All images - Alternate text was added

Forthcoming Work
As my knowledge of coding grows, I plan to make the following improvements:
Adjust blue shades for consistency
Apply filter to icons (invert=100%) and return text to white
Tweak spacing, padding, and margins
Improve grouping of sections within aside
Implement Aria labels (if necessary)
Implement tab to navigate all parts of page (not just links)
Tweak colors for better accessibility/high contrast preferences
Consolidate classes
Test site via a screen reader
Explore other possible arangements of navigation element and contents
Consider modifying links with buttons
Enable viewing on various devices
Review language to ensure succinctness
Consider if captions would be a better choice for screen readers, etc., than alternative text
